MAIN LOOP

PLAN:
    """
        We have an infinate while loop.
        This while loop will constantly request for data then feed to the analisys class.
        If we have taken trades, we must not take any more trades until they are closed.
        After taking the maximum trades, we store the tokens/ref and store them in a list.
        We need an inner loop to track the progress.
